* Minor version of database changed to 27 to indicate change in metadata table.
* Added option to change full path to settings using an absolute or a relative folder.
* Changed handling for MSFS file `Content.xml` for SU10. Priorities for known base folders are now

  add-on sceneries. #910
* Reduced logging for invalid MSFS BGL files.
* Now allowing BGL files from missions to catch respective airports for MSFS.

  display a single transition from addon (Community) SIDs and STARs, despite these procedures
  actually having more than one transition. This happens when using the latest MSFS SDK (SU9 or later).
* Moved version number to variable in file `atools.pro` instead of coding into sources.
* Now writing files `version.txt` and `revision.txt` files into deployment folder allowing

* Fixed issue where all airports were recognized as add-on with MSFS update 9.
* Fixed issues for updating airports by disabling a corner case from FSX and P3D which apparently
  does not apply to MSFS. Before a feature was not updated if the new airport did not contain new
  features like aprons or taxiways. Example LICC add-on.

  functions for runway comparison. albar965/littlenavmap#870

  optional column missing.
* Prepared data compilation for X-Plane 12 based on limited information. Added X-Plane 12 detection
  to FsPaths. Now allowing the `no simulator` state instead of using always active X-Plane.
  albar965/littlenavmap#867
